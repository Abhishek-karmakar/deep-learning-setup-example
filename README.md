Deeplearning Intro and Quick-definition

- With machine learning we define the outcome and the algorithm learns to reach there.
- There are a lot of machine learning models. One of them is Neural Network. 
- When we use not just one or two level deep by many many level deep. its called Deep learning. 
- Input values proess through all these hidden layers. 
- Also, Building Machine Learning Models with Deep Neural Network = Deep Learning 
- Deeplearning can be used to solve many problems like Classification problems or for Computer Vision or Recommendation systems using Deep Boltzman Machines. 


How to get the Dataset

	- get the dataset from https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwxlRNfHWeNkTWw0VVlkb245aEk/view?usp=sharing

Dataset explaination. 

	- Example dataset of a bank. 
	- Bank can see a increadible churn rate.i.e lot of people leaving the bank. 
	- Bank measured various datas for 6 months for various customer. 
	- Exited value means 1 = left , 0 = still with bank
	- 

Problem Statement

	- Based on the data, how can we create a model to predict if the customer will exit or will stay. 
	- This model can be applied to various scenarios where there are a lot of independent variables and where the out come is variable. 

	
Building ANN Part 1 - What libraries to use and installating those libraries.
	
	- Theano - Opensource numerical computation library. Very effecient for fast numerical comutation , based on Numpy systax, can run not only on CPU but also GPU.
	- TensorFlow - Another Opensource numerical compurations library. Build Deep Nerural network from scratch using Theano and Tensor Flow. 
	- Keras - Based-on and wraps the functions of Theano and Tenorflow. Deep Neural Network using few lines of code.
